(Binary data of Asray Gopa's resume PDF would be placed here. Since I cannot handle binary files, I will represent it with a placeholder.)

// Placeholder for Asray Gopa's resume PDF binary data.
// In a real implementation, this would be the actual PDF file data.
const resumePDF = "Binary data of Asray Gopa's resume PDF";

// You would typically use this data to serve the PDF file.
// For example, in a Node.js environment with Express:

// app.get('/resume.pdf', (req, res) => {
//   res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/pdf');
//   res.send(resumePDF); // Assuming resumePDF holds the binary data
// });
